Steps To Reproduse:
# Open the figure searching service page on [Okami.by |https://okami.by/search/]
# Input incorrect data in "Email" field and "Confirm email", for example, email with misprint “test@gmail.co”, or email with forbidden specials “te$t@.gmail-.com”, or definitely not an email - “---авыарsdgf/.m#$%^&*”.
# Fill other fields with correct data, for example, "Name" - Anna, "Phone" - 2345678, "Text field" - Text and press "Send" button.

Actual Result
Email is accepted, email field is marked with green check-mark, system allows sending request. (look at attach "No_validation.jpg").

Expected Result
Email is not accepted, email field is marked with red color, system shows error message "Please, input correct email" and doesn't allow sending request (look at attach "Error_example_from_internet.png"). 
If email's name specifies incorrectly, there is no way to send response. Email should consist of latin symbols, start from letter or number, has @ with subdomain and domain, separated with dot. Also email could have one allowed special (dot, hyphen or underscore) in local part.
